> A menu bar application built using [Electron](https://github.com/electron) that updates cryptocurrencies prices in real-time and allows users to create alerts for price changes. Pricing data is updated every minute and uses [CCCAGG](https://www.cryptocompare.com/media/12318004/cccagg.pdf) as the default exchange. The ability to configure a different exchange will be released soon.
